# Quoridor-AI
This brief, fun project was created for an IMSA intersession course. It is able to beat most human players at Quoridor, a boardgame centered around clever path planning. This deterministic AI utilizes a 2-layer minimax decision tree with A* shortest path algorithm as the heuristic. Warning: Source code is incredibly messy
